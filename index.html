<h1><center>Homelessness in NYC Since 2019:<br>Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Migrant Crisis</h1>

<!-- Story goes here -->

<div class="container">
<p> Between March of 2020 and March of 2022, there was a drop from around 60,000 people residing in DHS shelters to around 45,000. Since the Spring of 2022, there has been an unprecedented spike in DHS shelter residents, nearly doubling from a little over 45,000 in April of 2022 to just under 89,000 in November of 2023.</p>

<p>According to Leonard Feldman, associate professor of political science at Hunter College and author of <i>Citizens Without Shelter: Homelessness, Democracy, and Political Exclusion</i>, “the drop in numbers during the pandemic corresponds to the city initiative to relocate shelter residents to hotels.” He also explained that beyond the migrant crisis, “the other relevant factor is the pandemic protections against evictions,” which were cut when the pandemic ended. This also contributed to rising homelessness after the Spring of 2022.  </p>
